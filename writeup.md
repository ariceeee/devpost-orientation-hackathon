# :sparkles: Inspiration
Both of us are fairly new to Flask so we wanted to start simple. Hence, we took inspiration from a variety of visually appealing single page portfolios that we found online.

# :scroll: What it does
This is a simple portfolio website with a built-in Blog, perfect for a computer science student. The portfolio operates as a single page with a navigation bar that links to the About, Projects, and Experience sections to easily jump around the page. The Blog is also linked in the navigation bar, where you can then view previous posts or create a new one.

# :computer: How we built it

<b>Back-end:</b> Python, Flask and Firebase
<b>Front-end:</b> HTML, CSS

# :exploding_head: Challenges we ran into
Part of our wasn't familiar with Python and Flask, this made the environment setup process difficult, although with research and support from each other we were able to set it up. Furthermore, we hadn't worked with just HTML and CSS recently which slowed us down but we were able to pick it up quickly and get the project ready for a live demo.

# :thinking: What's next for Sponge Bob Portfolio?
Right now the portfolio is just a mock up, starring Spongebob and a number of placeholders. Eventually we'd like to each modify it to contain our own contact information, experiences, and projects.

We would also like to add Edit and Delete endpoints for the blog posts as well as restrict access to Add/Edit/Delete posts to only the owner.
