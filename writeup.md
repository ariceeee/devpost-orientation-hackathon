# :sparkles: Inspiration
Both of us are fairly new to Flask so we wanted to start simple. Hence, we took inspiration from a variety of visually appealing single page portfolios that we found online.

# :scroll: What it does
This is a simple portfolio website with a built-in Blog, perfect for a computer science student. The portfolio operates as a single page with a navigation bar that links to the About, Projects, and Experience sections to easily jump around the page. The Blog is also linked in the navigation bar, where you can then view previous posts or create a new one.

# :computer: How we built it

<b>Back-end:</b> Python, Flask and Firebase
<b>Front-end:</b> HTML, CSS

# :exploding_head: Challenges we ran into
We weren't very familiar with Python and Flask, which made the environment setup process difficult, although with research and support from each other we were able to set it up. In terms of front-end stuff, we had some experience with HTML and CSS but hadn't used it for a while. Through refering to documentation and tutorials, we were able to refresh our memory and get the project ready for a live demo.

# :partying_face: Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Finishing the project on time!
- Deploying the project
- Communication between the team
- Taking initative to learn things as we went

# :woman_student: What we learned
We learned that we need to be careful using GitHub and to follow best practices. We've become more aware of what branch we're working on, and are getting better at remembering to use branches when working on new features. We also learned about Jinja templates (the HTML files become Jinja templates when using Flask), as well as basic Python syntax and how to set up a development environment using Flask. 

# :boom: Shout outs
We'd like to thank Mahzad, who helped us to get set up with Flask, Python, IDE, venv, etc.

# :thinking: What's next for Sponge Bob Portfolio?
Right now the portfolio is just a mock up, starring Spongebob and a number of placeholders. Eventually we'd like to each modify it to contain our own contact information, experiences, and projects. We would also like to add Edit and Delete endpoints for the blog posts as well as restrict access to Add/Edit/Delete posts to only the owner.
